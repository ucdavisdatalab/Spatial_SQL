# Data

The data we'll be working with is a set of hydrology-related data for the San Francisco Bay Watershed.

You'll need to download the following data from the data folder in this repository or from [this Box folder](https://ucdavis.box.com/s/wb5ui86q8z7ppylvcqb8o8pqqawpsj43) (click the download button in the upper right corner to download all the data in one .zip file):

* Watershed Boundaries (Polygons)
* Watershed Centroids (Points)
* Rivers (Lines)

If you downloaded a .zip file, be sure to unzip it.
