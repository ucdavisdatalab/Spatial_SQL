We will work with a graphical user interface (GUI) and explore some examples of common analysis processes as well as present participants with resources for continued learning. This workshop will give participants a solid foundation on which to build further learning. 0.1.1 Learning Objectives By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to Import data into an spatialite database Write queries to answer questions about spatial data Understand the difference between attribute queries and geometry queries View spatial tables and views in QGIS Use terminology related to spatial databases to facilitate future learning 0.1.2 Prerequisites An introductory understanding of SQL is recommended, but not mandatory. For example, knowing how to compose a SELECT statement using SQL and the general concept of joining tables will serve learners well. For learners without a foundation in SQL, we recommend attending or reviewing the materials for DataLabâ€™s Introduction to Databases and Data Storage Technologies, which introduces the concept of databases, and Intro to SQL for Querying Databases, which teaches the basics of querying data using SQL.
